# AndroidImageProcApp

An Android app for image processing. Based on the Color Blob OpenCV/Android tutorial.
Next step is to add in the computer vision functions from the PyVisionGUI project and improve the Android GUI to use these functions.
The classical image processing functions using OpenCV should work without trouble. 
The deeplap deep learning models for segmentation may take too long to run on a mobile processor. Tests must be performed.
